# React Suspense Sandbox

Playing with the most exciting React feature.

## Running the demos

After cloning the repo, install dependencies via Yarn Workspaces

    yarn install

Or pointing to a specific demo you need

    cd packages/$DEMO
    npm install

To run a demo, open a specific one and start dev server

    yarn start

Since React Suspense is not released yet, the libs (`react`, `react-dom`, and
`simple-cache-provider`) were build from React's master branch and are located
in `packages/`.
