# React Suspense Sandbox

Playing with the most exciting React feature.

## Usage

After cloning the repo, install dependencies and start the dev server.

    yarn start

Check `src/` folder for the source code. Since React Suspense is not released
yet, the libs were build from React's master branch and are located in `lib/`.
